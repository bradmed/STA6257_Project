Introduction
This is an introduction to Kernel regression, which is a non-parametric estimator that estimates the conditional expectation of two variables which is random. The goal of a kernel regression is to discover the non-linear relationship between two random variables. To discover the non-linear relationship, kernel estimator or kernel smoothing is the main method to estimate the curve for non-parametric statistics. In kernel estimator, weight function is known as kernel function (Efromovich 2008). Cite this paper (Bro and Smilde 2014). The GEE (Wang 2014).
